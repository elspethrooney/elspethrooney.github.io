    I have tested this faucet site for a few months. I analyzed all of their features.
    I have to conclude that I would recommend this site. Keep in mind,
    this post can be updated in future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is the site legit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    According to my tests (deposit/withdraw), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt; is legit.
    The &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt; is on the market for many years.
    During all my tests and experiments, I have not noticed anything suspicious.
    All of their features has reasonable parameters - they are not promising miracles.
    Also they are very transparent and their games can be classified as a provably fair.
    I also wrote Python script to replicate the random number generation process from
    server and user hash and I have to admit it is fair.
    They responded to my emails promptly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Free faucet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The amount of BTC you can get from their faucet is derived from the value of USD.
    The biggest price you can get is BTC equivalent of $200.
    Every time you roll the faucet you have a chance 1:10000 to get the maximal price.
    There are also other bigger prices with various chances to success.
    The lowest price is approximately 0.002 USD. You can roll the faucet every 60 minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    How much can you get? In case you roll 10k times with an average luck
    (your rolls contain every possible number 1-1000 exactly once),
    then you win $270 worth in BTC. So in case you roll ten times per day,
    you get $270 in about 1k days (less than 3 years),
    or in other words $0.27 per day. Keep in mind that these numbers are
    average estimate for person with average luck in a long run.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multiply BTC - HI-LO game &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Their multiply BTC feature is traditional HI-LO game
    with quite a sophisticated interface.
    The rolls are fair. You can validate each roll
    according to the server hash. However,
    no matter what settings you use, the game is set to return
    back to the users only only fraction of the bets.
    If you set the game to coin flip mode, you will get only 47.5% winning
    chance. You would need 50% to stay even. So there is no chance to win
    in a long run with an average luck.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Earn - interest savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every balance higher than 30k satoshi is automatically increased daily.
Currently the earning rate is set to 4.08% yearly,
so it is roughly 1 satoshi per day for every 10k satoshi you have.
The interest rate is similar to other legit services, so I would trust it is not a scam trick.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There are actually two lotteries.
    You can buy or obtain tickets as reward for using their features.
    However the lotteries are not worthy in a long run.
    The prize of ticket is higher than an expected value.
    In other words, you pay more than you can actually win.
    The lottery is good only for fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Betting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt;
    features quite an unique perimutuel betting option.
    The odds are set according to the pool size of the bet options.
    Example: if the most users bet on team A,
    you can get a much better odd on the team B.
    In common betting office you get odds according
    to an extremely precise prediction model, so you have
    a very little chance to win something in a long run.
    However, with the perimutuel betting the odds
    are given by actual bettors.
    Thus if you understand any topic - sport, politics etc. better
    than other people do, you should definitely try betting via
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I randomly bet on random topics for more than 150+ times on
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt;
    with outcome close to 0. Thus I assume that their fee is low
    and the winners are payed fairly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Referral program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt; has probably the
    best referral program I have ever seen:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;50% of your referral free rolls&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;reward points for referral bets, hi-lo rolls&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;25% commissions on any interest earned by your referrals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    Furthermore, you can reward your referrals with share from your profits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reward program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt;
    also features interesting reward program. They pay you with reward points
    almost for every action you do (or your referrals do).
    You exchange the reward points for various prizes,
    or you can change them for BTC
    - one reward points is equal to one satoshi.
    Keep in mind that the exchange for BTC is
    possible only if you collect at least 100k of reward points.
    Also if you play free faucet more
    than 12 times per day, it is worthy to buy the reward
    point booster. You can buy this booster
    for 1200 reward points, and it grants you 100 extra
    points for every free roll.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recommended strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    To gain as much as possible via
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt; I would
    recommend:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;roll faucet as often as possible&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;bet on events if you have the skill
    and knowledge to beat other players&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;choose to get reward points instead of lottery
            tickets in your profile settings
            (go to PROFILE/DISABLE LOTTERY &amp; INTEREST/check DISABLE LOTTERY)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;collect reward points and exchange them for BTC&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;strictly avoid the lottery and hi-lo game&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;get some active referrals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pros:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a decent faucet that pays, if you are consistent and diligent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They feature unique betting system than can be highly productive - depends on your skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their referral program is just awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They automatically give you interest if you have more than 30k satoshi&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They are not living from ads, so they do not force you to observe junk ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Cons:&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HI-LO game - this game is good for fun, but you cannot actually win in a long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lottery - the tickets are not worthy in the long run (like with every lottery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would strongly recommend to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://freebitco.in/?r=38728911&quot;&gt;freebitco.in&lt;/a&gt;
as a viable option in your free BTC site portfolio.
